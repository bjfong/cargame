# Cargame

This repository contains a little game that I would play while stuck in traffic.

The game goes like this:
On license plates with one number, three letters, and three numbers, take the three letters and find words in the English language that contain those letters in the same order that they appear.

For example, if the three letters were "ave", then "favorite", "have", "gave", "avenue", and "halves" would be valid words, among many others.

This has gotten me through some rough times in traffic so I decided to make an interface to accompany this. Try it out!


Directions:

1) Download the repository.
2) Install the dependencies (This assumes you have NodeJS installed)
	--Run "npm install" to install these dependencies.
3) Run the server with:
	--"node index.js"
4) Go to your browser and type in: localhost:3000

Enjoy!
